What am I talking about now? Utility. And I don’t shill anything.  I said doge was better than a lottery ticket. Then people started using it to buy things\n",

      "1389006710795296769 2021-05-02 18:59:41 -0500 <mcuban> @spindel5 I still don't like btc as a currency. That's always been the issue.  And people aren't using it as currency. No one really buys anything with it. Would you spend your btc ?\n",
      "1389004112654655489 2021-05-02 18:49:21 -0500 <mcuban> Crypto succeeds when it's a more productive implementation of it's competition. BTC/Gold are both financial religions. BTC is easy to trade/store/create with no delivery issues. BTC also enables transfer of value locally and globally . Gold is a hassle. Just look at Ft Knox\n",
      "1387861184976760834 2021-04-29 15:07:46 -0500 <mcuban> Great. But you will put the $1m into a smart contract and we will take feeds for your stocks and my choice of half eth/btc and the winner's charity gets paid in 10 years, right ?  I'm not taking anybody's word that they will pay up in 10 yrs.  Sorry.\n",
      "1387778236093014016 2021-04-29 09:38:09 -0500 <mcuban> How about this. We set up a ln eth smart contract. You put in $1m in a stablecoin. I put up $1m in a stablecoin. We write the contract to pay you if the increase in the S&amp;P 500 is higher at the end date than the increase in YOUR choice of BTC or ETH. You can pick the custodian\n",

Told everyone that my stock buying thesis is to buy companies great at AI. Used some cash to buy more btc, eth, MKR Holding some cash for next downturn. Rinse/Repeat\n",
      "1387432242197139464 2021-04-28 10:43:18 -0500 <mcuban> If you look at crypto assets whether eth, doge, btc,mkr etc and only see something intangible  for people to trade, you haven't really looked. If you see smart contracts and programming languages and  think of new ways to disrupt industries then I'm saying there's a chance\n",
      "1387277151683100672 2021-04-28 00:27:01 -0500 <mcuban> @CoinDesk @TheEllenShow This is exactly why people will buy physical products with doge coin and not with btc and rarely with eth.   It’s hard for someone with $100 to get excited about owning a fraction of btc or eth.  It’s easy with doge. When it appreciates that makes those items easy 2 buy\n",

      "1366857486586757123 2021-03-02 15:06:34 -0500 <mcuban> @CryptoHarper What i said a couple years ago was that it wasnt a currency and didnt have any immediate utility. Unlike a banana that i could eat :). What has changed is De-Fi. Now BTC/Eth/Others can make you your own personal banker and facilitate many other types of trx Thats utility\n",
      "1366787249644445703 2021-03-02 10:27:28 -0500 <mcuban> Let me help Peter. Gold is hyped as much as Crypto. Do we really need gold jewelry? Gold can make you a ring. BTC/Eth are technologies that can make you a banker, allow friction free exchange of value and are extensible into an unlimited range of biz and personal applications\n",
